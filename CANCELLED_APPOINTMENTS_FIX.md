# Cancelled Appointments - Hide from List

## Change Applied ✓

**Requirement:** When admin deletes/cancels an appointment, it should **disappear** from the appointments list.

## What Was Changed

### Before:
- Cancelled appointments remained visible in the list with "cancelled" status badge
- They were stored in database but still shown to admin and patients

### After:
- Cancelled appointments are **filtered out** and hidden from all lists
- They remain in database (for records/audit) but don't appear in UI
- Both admin and patient views exclude cancelled appointments

---

## Technical Changes

### File Modified: `app_supabase.py`

### 1. Admin Appointments List (Line 551-567)
```python
@app.route('/api/appointments/all', methods=['GET'])
def all_appointments():
    result = supabase_select('appointments', 'order=created_at.desc')
    
    # Filter out cancelled appointments - they should not appear in the list
    active_appointments = [apt for apt in result if apt.get('status') != 'cancelled']
    
    return jsonify({
        'appointments': active_appointments,
        'count': len(active_appointments),
        'total_patients': len(set(apt.get('patient_email') for apt in active_appointments))
    }), 200
```

### 2. Patient Appointments List (Line 440-464)
```python
@app.route('/api/appointments/my-appointments', methods=['GET'])
def my_appointments():
    result = supabase_select('appointments', f'patient_email=eq.{user_email}&payment_status=eq.completed')
    
    # Filter out cancelled appointments
    active_appointments = [apt for apt in result if apt.get('status') != 'cancelled']
    
    return jsonify({
        'appointments': active_appointments
    }), 200
```

## How It Works Now

### When Admin Clicks Delete:

1. **Appointment is cancelled** in database
   - `status` → 'cancelled'
   - `payment_status` → 'refunded' or 'cancelled'
   - `cancelled_at` → current timestamp

2. **Frontend refreshes** the appointments list

3. **API returns filtered data** (excludes cancelled)

4. **Appointment disappears** from the list ✓

5. **Revenue is updated** (refunds subtracted)

## Benefits

✓ **Clean UI** - No clutter from cancelled appointments  
✓ **Better UX** - Users only see active appointments  
✓ **Data preserved** - Cancelled appointments still in database for audit  
✓ **Revenue accurate** - Cancelled appointments excluded from calculations  

---

## Database vs Display

| Location | Cancelled Appointments |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Database** | ✓ Stored (for audit trail) |
| **Admin List** | ✗ Hidden (filtered out) |
| **Patient List** | ✗ Hidden (filtered out) |
| **Revenue Calculation** | ✗ Excluded (not counted) |
| **Statistics** | ✗ Excluded (not counted) |

---

## Testing

### Test the Fix:
1. Go to: `http://localhost:5000/admin/appointments`
2. Click delete (trash icon) on any appointment
3. Confirm deletion
4. **Result:** Appointment immediately disappears from list ✓

### Verify in Database:
- Appointment still exists in Supabase with `status = 'cancelled'`
- Can be viewed in Supabase dashboard if needed for audit

---

## Important Notes

1. **Appointments are NOT permanently deleted** - They're marked as cancelled in the database
2. **Data is preserved** - For accounting, audit trails, and compliance
3. **UI is clean** - Users don't see cancelled appointments
4. **Can be restored** - If needed, can change status back in database

## If You Want to View Cancelled Appointments

If you need to see cancelled appointments for audit purposes, you can:

### Option 1: Add a "Show Cancelled" Filter
Add a checkbox in the admin panel to toggle cancelled appointments visibility.

### Option 2: Create a Separate "Cancelled Appointments" Page
Create a dedicated page to view only cancelled appointments.

### Option 3: View in Database
Access Supabase dashboard directly to see all appointments including cancelled.

Let me know if you want me to implement any of these options!
