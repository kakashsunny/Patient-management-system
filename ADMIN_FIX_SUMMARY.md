# Admin Dashboard Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Revenue Calculation Issue ✓

**Problem:** 
- Revenue was showing the total of ALL completed appointments (lifetime), not just the current month
- When appointments were deleted/cancelled, the revenue wasn't being updated correctly

**Root Cause:**
The dashboard was calculating revenue by summing ALL appointments with `payment_status == 'completed'` without filtering by month.

**Solution Applied:**
```python
# OLD CODE (incorrect):
monthly_revenue = sum(float(a.get('consultation_fee', 0)) 
                    for a in active_appointments 
                    if a.get('payment_status') == 'completed')

# NEW CODE (correct):
current_month = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m')

monthly_revenue = sum(
    float(a.get('consultation_fee', 0)) 
    for a in active_appointments 
    if a.get('payment_status') == 'completed' 
    and a.get('date', '').startswith(current_month)  # Filter by current month
)

# Subtract refunded amounts
refunded_amount = sum(
    float(a.get('consultation_fee', 0))
    for a in all_appointments
    if a.get('payment_status') == 'refunded'
    and a.get('date', '').startswith(current_month)
)

monthly_revenue = monthly_revenue - refunded_amount
```

**What This Fixes:**
- ✓ Revenue now shows only the current month's earnings
- ✓ Revenue automatically updates when appointments are added
- ✓ Revenue decreases when appointments are cancelled/refunded
- ✓ Accurate financial reporting

### 2. Delete Appointment Issue ✓

**Problem:**
- When admin clicked delete, appointments would disappear from the list
- No proper tracking of cancelled appointments
- Payment status wasn't being handled correctly

**Root Cause:**
The delete function was setting `payment_status = 'cancelled'` for all appointments, even those that were already paid. This didn't properly track refunds.

**Solution Applied:**
```python
# Enhanced delete function with proper status handling
@app.route('/api/appointments/<appointment_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_appointment(appointment_id):
    # First, get the appointment to check its current payment status
    appointments = supabase_select('appointments', f'appointment_id=eq.{appointment_id}')
    
    if not appointments or len(appointments) == 0:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Appointment not found'}), 404
    
    appointment = appointments[0]
    
    # Update appointment status to cancelled
    update_data = {
        'status': 'cancelled',
        # If already paid, mark as refunded; otherwise cancelled
        'payment_status': 'refunded' if appointment.get('payment_status') == 'completed' else 'cancelled',
        'cancelled_at': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    
    result = supabase_update('appointments', update_data, 'appointment_id', appointment_id)
    
    if result:
        return jsonify({
            'success': True,
            'message': 'Appointment cancelled successfully',
            'appointment': result[0] if isinstance(result, list) else result
        }), 200
```

**What This Fixes:**
- ✓ Appointments are marked as 'cancelled', not deleted from database
- ✓ Paid appointments are marked as 'refunded' (for accounting)
- ✓ Unpaid appointments are marked as 'cancelled'
- ✓ Timestamp of cancellation is recorded
- ✓ Appointments still visible in admin panel with 'cancelled' status
- ✓ Revenue calculation properly excludes cancelled/refunded appointments

## How It Works Now

### Revenue Calculation Flow:
1. **Get all appointments** from database
2. **Filter out cancelled** appointments (status != 'cancelled')
3. **Calculate monthly revenue:**
   - Sum consultation fees where:
     - `payment_status == 'completed'`
     - `date` starts with current month (e.g., '2025-10')
4. **Subtract refunds:**
   - Sum consultation fees where:
     - `payment_status == 'refunded'`
     - `date` starts with current month
5. **Display final revenue** = (completed payments) - (refunds)

### Delete Appointment Flow:
1. **Admin clicks delete** button
2. **System checks** if appointment exists
3. **System checks** payment status:
   - If `payment_status == 'completed'` → Set to `'refunded'`
   - Otherwise → Set to `'cancelled'`
4. **Update appointment** in database:
   - `status = 'cancelled'`
   - `payment_status = 'refunded'` or `'cancelled'`
   - `cancelled_at = current timestamp`
5. **Return success** with updated appointment data
6. **Frontend refreshes** appointment list
7. **Appointment shows** with red 'cancelled' badge

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Revenue Calculation:
1. Open admin dashboard: `http://localhost:5000/admin`
2. Check "Monthly Revenue" card
3. Create a new appointment for current month
4. Revenue should increase by consultation fee
5. Cancel the appointment
6. Revenue should decrease back

### Test Delete Appointment:
1. Go to Appointments page: `http://localhost:5000/admin/appointments`
2. Click delete (trash icon) on any appointment
3. Confirm deletion
4. Appointment should:
   - ✓ Still appear in the list
   - ✓ Show "cancelled" status badge (red)
   - ✓ Show "refunded" or "cancelled" payment status
   - ✓ Not be counted in revenue
