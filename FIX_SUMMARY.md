# Live Server Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

Your Flask server was **failing to start** due to **Unicode encoding errors** on Windows. The issue was NOT with "Live Server" - it was with emoji characters in the Python code that couldn't be encoded in Windows' default `cp1252` encoding.

## Root Cause

Multiple Python files contained emoji characters (🏥, 🚀, ✅, ❌, ⚠️, etc.) in print statements. When Python tried to output these to the Windows console, it caused `UnicodeEncodeError` exceptions, preventing the server from starting.

## Files Fixed

The following files had emoji characters replaced with text labels:

1. **utils/db.py** - Firebase initialization messages
2. **utils/supabase_db.py** - Supabase connection messages
3. **utils/notifications.py** - Email/SMS notification logs
4. **utils/login_tracker.py** - Login tracking logs
5. **app.py** - Server startup messages
6. **app_supabase.py** - Supabase version startup messages
7. **setup_admin.py** - Admin setup messages

## Changes Made

All emoji characters were replaced with text labels in square brackets:
- ✅ → [SUCCESS]
- ❌ → [ERROR]
- ⚠️ → [WARNING]
- 🏥 → [HOSPITAL]
- 🚀 → [STARTING]
- 📍 → [SERVER]
- 📊 → [ADMIN]
- 👤 → [PATIENT]

## Current Status

✓ **Server is now running successfully on port 5000**

## How to Access Your Application

### Option 1: Using Browser (Recommended)
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:5000**
3. Admin dashboard: **http://localhost:5000/admin**
4. Login page: **http://localhost:5000/login**

### Option 2: Using the Batch File
Double-click `run.bat` in the project folder

## Important Notes

### About "Live Server"
- **VS Code Live Server extension does NOT work with Flask applications**
- Live Server is only for static HTML files
- Flask applications must be run using Python: `python app.py` or `python app_supabase.py`

### Which App File to Use?

**Currently Running:** `app_supabase.py` (Supabase version)

**Why?** Because `firebase-credentials.json` is missing. You have two options:

#### Option A: Continue with Supabase (Easier)
- Already running and working
- No additional setup needed if .env has Supabase credentials
- Run with: `python app_supabase.py`

#### Option B: Switch to Firebase
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Download service account key
4. Save as `firebase-credentials.json` in project root
5. Run with: `python app.py`

## How to Start/Stop Server

### Start Server
```bash
# Supabase version (currently running)
python app_supabase.py

# OR Firebase version (if you have credentials)
python app.py
```

### Stop Server
Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running

### Check if Server is Running
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
1. Check if port 5000 is already in use
2. Kill existing process: `taskkill /F /PID <process_id>`
3. Try starting again

### Can't access in browser
1. Make sure server is running (check terminal output)
2. Try: http://127.0.0.1:5000 instead of localhost
3. Check firewall settings

### Database errors
- **Supabase version:** Check .env file has SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY
- **Firebase version:** Ensure firebase-credentials.json exists

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Server is running
2. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
3. Create an admin account (if not done): `python setup_admin.py`
4. Login and start using the system

## Technical Details

**Server:** Flask 3.0.0  
**Port:** 5000  
**Host:** 0.0.0.0 (accessible from any network interface)  
**Debug Mode:** Enabled  
**Database:** Supabase (currently) or Firebase  
**Python Version:** 3.14.0  

---

**Remember:** Always use `python app_supabase.py` or `python app.py` to run the server, NOT the Live Server extension!
